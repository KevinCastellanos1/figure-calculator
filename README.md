            <hr><h3 align="center">Code Explanation</h3><hr>        
            <p>The calculator has input fields where the user can enter the required dimensions of the figure they want to calculate. Depending on which figure they want to calculate, the calculator will have different options. For two-dimensional figures, the user can calculate its area and perimeter. For three-dimensional figures, the user can calculate its volume.</p>
            <P>The code is organized into separate functions for each of the calculations. The functions take input from the user, perform the calculation, and display the result on the screen. The user can then reset the calculator to perform another calculation.</P>

            <p>1. How can I use this calculator?</p>            
            <p>- Simply open the web page in your browser and enter the required dimensions of the figure you want to calculate. The calculator will display the result on the screen.</p>        
            <p>2. What technologies were used to develop the project?</p>            
            <p>- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript were used to develop the project.</p>
            <p>3. How accurate are the calculations?</p>            
            <p>- The calculations are accurate up to the number of decimal places shown on the screen. However, please note that the accuracy may be affected by rounding errors or the limitations of JavaScript's floating-point arithmetic.</p>            
            <p>4. Can I use this code for my own projects?</p>            
            <p>- Yes, you can use and modify this code for your own projects. However, please give credit to the original author.</p>            
            <p>5. Can I change the units of measurement used by the calculator?</p>
            <p>- The calculator currently uses the metric system for its calculations. However, you can modify the code to use other units of measurement such as inches, feet, or miles. Simply update the appropriate conversion factors in the code to reflect the new units of measurement.</p>
